# Trajectory visualiser 
This project is my best approximation to what flight software engineering might look like within the limits of my student flat. 

It takes a webcam stream, detects a target, interpolates its aerial trajectory and graphs its flight path - all in real time.

It uses C++ and OpenCV for image processing, then sends data over a UDP websocket to a python program which uses sympy and Matplotlib to evaluate and graph the results.


## Demo
Coming soon ...
